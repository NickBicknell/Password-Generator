# Password-Generator

## Description  

I created a random password generator to provide a secure and unique password. The password generator allows the user to input their desired length as long as it is in the set parameters (between 8 and 128 characters), and they can select if they want their password to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. This is a very useful tool and can come in handy when a user wants to create a secure and complex password to keep their account safe. In this project, I became more familiar and confident in using javascript elements such as variables, arrays, functions, if statements, for loops, and different types of window prompts like alert and confirm. 

## Usage

When the webpage is loaded up, you are displayed with a simple layout with an empty text box and a big red button labled **Generate Password**. When the user clicks the generate password button, they will be displayed with their first prompt asking the desired length of the password, ex: 12. After the user inputs the length for the desired password, 4 window confirm prompts will ask the user if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. Then a unqiue and randomly generated password will be displayed using only the character types the user selected.
